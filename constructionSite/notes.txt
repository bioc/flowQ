Framework for quality assessment of flowSet objects


Each flow QA process is encapsulated in an object of class
'qaProcess'. Lists of theses processes along with a flowSet can be
supplied to the function' qaReport' which will created HTML output
that hyperlinks to more detailed diagnostic plots.

qaProcess objects consist of:
1.) A name of the process. This is optional and can be an arbitary
description of the process, e.g. "time line quality assessment for
channel xyz". Names of the process may be assigned freely during
object instantiation by the user.

2.) The type of the process, a category like "time line". This should
be hardcoded within the object instantiator and not be acessible by
the user.

3.) frameGraphs: A list of qaGraph objects that are created as
graphical output by the QA process
